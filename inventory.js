// check each item from second array against items in first array (indexOf?)
    // if item already exists, add value from second array to first array
    // if item doesn't exist, add it + value to first array
    // (not sure how to add it in the right position - maybe sort after the fact? but not sure that would look at second values in arrays)

Inventory Update
Compare and update the inventory stored in a 2D array against a second 2D array of a fresh delivery. Update the current existing inventory item quantities (in arr1). If an item cannot be found, add the new item and quantity into the inventory array. The returned inventory array should be in alphabetical order by item.

The function updateInventory should return an array.
updateInventory([[21, "Bowling Ball"], [2, "Dirty Sock"], [1, "Hair Pin"], [5, "Microphone"]], [[2, "Hair Pin"], [3, "Half-Eaten Apple"], [67, "Bowling Ball"], [7, "Toothpaste"]]).length should return an array with a length of 6.
updateInventory([[21, "Bowling Ball"], [2, "Dirty Sock"], [1, "Hair Pin"], [5, "Microphone"]], [[2, "Hair Pin"], [3, "Half-Eaten Apple"], [67, "Bowling Ball"], [7, "Toothpaste"]]) should return [[88, "Bowling Ball"], [2, "Dirty Sock"], [3, "Hair Pin"], [3, "Half-Eaten Apple"], [5, "Microphone"], [7, "Toothpaste"]].
updateInventory([[21, "Bowling Ball"], [2, "Dirty Sock"], [1, "Hair Pin"], [5, "Microphone"]], []) should return [[21, "Bowling Ball"], [2, "Dirty Sock"], [1, "Hair Pin"], [5, "Microphone"]].
updateInventory([], [[2, "Hair Pin"], [3, "Half-Eaten Apple"], [67, "Bowling Ball"], [7, "Toothpaste"]]) should return [[67, "Bowling Ball"], [2, "Hair Pin"], [3, "Half-Eaten Apple"], [7, "Toothpaste"]].
updateInventory([[0, "Bowling Ball"], [0, "Dirty Sock"], [0, "Hair Pin"], [0, "Microphone"]], [[1, "Hair Pin"], [1, "Half-Eaten Apple"], [1, "Bowling Ball"], [1, "Toothpaste"]]) should return [[1, "Bowling Ball"], [0, "Dirty Sock"], [1, "Hair Pin"], [1, "Half-Eaten Apple"], [0, "Microphone"], [1, "Toothpaste"]].
